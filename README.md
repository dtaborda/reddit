# React scaffolding

An opinionated scaffolding with the following technical stack and configuration:

* React  (15.x)
* React Router (2.x)
* Flux by using Redux (3.x)
* Webpack
* CSS Modules
* SASS
* Seamless Immutable
* Hot module replacement
* Babel
* Testing mocha + shallow rendering with React

The idea is to provide a base structure that enable consumers to start building freatures and deliver a production ready package of a Single Page App.

## TO DO

- [ ] Better examples of styling and way of shaing styles between css modules and js
- [ ] Test examples for unit test with shallow rendering.

## Getting started

To start hacking simply do:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
Point browser to http://localhost:3000

## Rational behind the stack

Check the resources [section](https://github.com/dtaborda/reddit/wiki) for talks and explanations on WHY the stack I present here.

### Bundle process

The scaffolding provides a feature-rich configuration for delivering the application as well as a rich development experience.
